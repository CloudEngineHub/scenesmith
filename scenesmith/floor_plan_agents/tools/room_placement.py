"""Slot-based room placement algorithm with backtracking search.

This module implements an optimal room placement algorithm that satisfies
adjacency constraints while minimizing bounding box size and maintaining
layout stability across iterative edits.

Algorithm Overview
------------------
1. **Topological Sort**: Rooms sorted by adjacency dependencies. Anchor rooms
   (no adjacencies) placed first, then connector rooms that link them.

2. **First Room at Origin**: The first sorted room is placed at (0, 0).

3. **Slot-Based Attachment**: Each placed room exposes 4 edge slots (N/S/E/W).
   New rooms attach to slots of rooms they must be adjacent to.

4. **Backtracking Search**: Explores all valid placements recursively:
   - For each unplaced room, generate all valid candidate positions
   - Sort candidates by local score (adjacency satisfaction, compactness)
   - Recurse on each candidate, tracking the best complete layout found
   - Prune branches on timeout (anytime algorithm behavior)

5. **Global Scoring**: Complete layouts scored by:
   - Compactness: ratio of room area to bounding box area (higher = better)
   - Stability: proximity to previous positions (for iterative editing)

Properties
----------
- **Optimality**: Finds optimal layout within *fixed room ordering* and *discrete
  position space*. Two limitations:
  1. Room order fixed by topological sort (anchor rooms first, then connectors).
     Different orderings could yield different layouts, but exploring all O(n!)
     orderings is intractable.
  2. Positions sampled at 11 evenly-spaced points per slot edge (0%, 10%, ..., 100%).
  With ≤10 rooms and 5s timeout, typically explores all valid positions for the
  fixed ordering.

- **Anytime Behavior**: Returns best-found-so-far if timeout exceeded. Search
  is best-first (candidates sorted by score), so early layouts are good.

- **Soundness**: All returned layouts satisfy adjacency constraints. Candidates
  that don't satisfy required adjacencies to placed rooms are rejected during
  scoring (score=0), ensuring only valid placements are explored.

- **Completeness**: If a valid layout exists for the fixed room ordering and
  discrete position space, the algorithm will find it (given sufficient time).
  Returns PlacementError only when no valid layout exists within these constraints.

Features
--------
- 90° room rotation: Automatically tries rotated orientation for better fit
- Multi-adjacency: Corner-aligned positions for rooms adjacent to 2+ others
- Layout stability: Configurable preference for positions near previous layout
