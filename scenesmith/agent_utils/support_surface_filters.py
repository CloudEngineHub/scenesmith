    """Filter surface by inscribed radius using convex hull analysis.

    Computes the true inscribed radius of the surface by:
    1. Computing 2D convex hull of surface mesh vertices
    2. Finding minimum distance from centroid to hull edges
    3. Capping at half the smaller bounding box dimension (prevents inflation
       for thin rectangles)

    This is more robust than simple width/depth thresholds as it:
    - Handles degenerate geometry (collinear/duplicate vertices)
    - Accounts for actual surface shape, not just bounding box
    - Prevents false positives on thin rectangles

    Args:
        surface: SupportSurface object with mesh geometry.
        min_inscribed_radius_m: Minimum inscribed radius threshold in meters.

    Returns:

        - should_keep: True if surface passes filter, False otherwise
