prompt: |
  Generate a clean product photography image of: {{ description }}.
  Style: {{ style_prompt }}.
  IMPORTANT: The image must show ONLY the object itself against a fully
  opaque, plain, solid-colored background that clearly contrasts with the
  object (e.g., dark background for light/white objects, light background
  for dark objects). The background MUST be visible and filled with a solid
  color - NEVER use transparent or alpha channel backgrounds. No wireframes,
  no technical drawings, no construction lines, no blueprints, no CAD
  elements, no shadows. Just a clear, photorealistic rendering of the actual
  object as it would appear in real life with even lighting, suitable for
  conversion to a 3D model.
