  Design this room with furniture through iterative refinement. Coordinate between the
  designer and critic agents to create a well-designed, functional, and comfortable space.

  Pursue multiple rounds of improvement:
  - Start with initial design and functional fixes
  - Then focus on spatial optimization and comfort enhancements
  - Continue until meaningful improvements are no longer emerging

  Your goal is not just a "working" room, but a thoughtfully designed space that
  maximizes comfort, functionality, and spatial efficiency.
