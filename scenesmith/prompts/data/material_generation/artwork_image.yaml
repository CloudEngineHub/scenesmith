  MANDATORY - READ CAREFULLY:
  The generated image will be PRINTED DIRECTLY onto a physical surface.
  There is NO wall behind it. The image IS the surface.

  Therefore:
  - Content must touch ALL 4 EDGES (top, bottom, left, right)
  - ZERO pixels of background color (no white, gray, beige, or any solid color)
  - If a FRAME is mentioned: crop so frame edges ARE the image edges
  - Think of this as a TEXTURE that will be applied to a 3D surface

  VISUAL COMPOSITION:
  - Flat frontal view only (no angle, no perspective, no 3D look)
  - No shadows, no depth effects
  - Fill every single pixel with meaningful content

  COMMON MISTAKE TO AVOID:
  Do NOT generate "a painting hanging on a wall" or "framed art with wall visible".
  Instead generate ONLY the painting itself, cropped to fill the entire canvas.
  The frame (if requested) should be CROPPED so its outer edges touch image edges.
