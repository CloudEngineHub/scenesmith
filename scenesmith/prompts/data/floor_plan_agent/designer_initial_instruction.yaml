  Create the initial floor plan design based on the house description.

  Follow the workflow phases:
  1. Generate room specifications with appropriate sizes
  2. Set wall height based on style
  3. Add doors (at least one exterior door required)
  4. Add windows to exterior walls
  5. Set materials for each room and exterior
  6. Validate the final design

  Start with generate_room_specs() to create the room layout, then proceed
  through each phase. Use render_ascii() to visualize the layout at any point.

  When complete, summarize what you created.
