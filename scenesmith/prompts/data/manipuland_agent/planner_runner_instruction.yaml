  Populate this furniture with appropriate manipuland objects through iterative
  refinement. Coordinate between the designer and critic agents to create a thoughtfully
  arranged collection.

  Remember to select placement style first (natural for lived-in realism with slight
  variation, or perfect for pristine museum-like precision). Natural is the default
  choice for most scenarios.

  Pursue multiple rounds of improvement:
  - Start with initial object placement focusing on realism and functionality
  - Then focus on layout quality and completion (appropriate density)
  - Continue until meaningful improvements are no longer emerging

  Your goal is not just "some objects on the surface", but a thoughtfully arranged
  collection that maximizes realism, functionality, layout quality, and completion for
  the furniture and scene context.
