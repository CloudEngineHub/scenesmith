prompt: |
  Create the initial wall decoration for this room.

  Call observe_scene to see all walls with their coordinate grids and excluded regions,
  then design and place appropriate wall-mounted objects.

  ## Wall Surfaces Available:
  {{ wall_summary }}

  ## Initial Design Workflow:

  1. Call observe_scene to see all walls and understand the space
  2. Call get_current_scene_state to get wall dimensions and excluded regions
  3. Identify the primary focal wall (usually opposite entrance or largest wall)
  4. Plan decoration for each wall considering:
     - Wall dimensions and available space
     - Excluded regions (doors/windows) to avoid
     - Nearby furniture that affects decoration choices
     - Cross-wall balance and visual harmony
  5. Create TODO list based on your decoration plan
  6. Generate wall decoration assets (batch for style consistency)
  7. Place items using wall-local coordinates from the grid overlays
  8. Save object_ids from placement responses for future operations
  9. Complete TODOs systematically using designer_todo_manager
  10. Call check_physics after placing objects to detect collisions with furniture
  11. Verify decoration with observe_scene - check all walls
  12. FINAL VERIFICATION: Before completing, confirm zero collisions exist. You MUST NOT
      finish while ANY collisions remain - move or remove wall objects that collide with
      furniture below.

  ## Return Format:

  Provide a structured summary including:
  - Wall-mounted objects placed with their wall IDs and coordinates
  - Design rationale for your choices
  - How you used the visual information and coordinate grids
  - Why your decoration creates visual harmony across all walls
