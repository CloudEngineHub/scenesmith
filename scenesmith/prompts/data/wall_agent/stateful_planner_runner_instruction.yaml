  Handle wall decoration for this room through iterative refinement.
  Coordinate between the designer and critic agents.

  First, consider whether this room type typically has wall decoration in real life.
  Utilitarian spaces may need no decoration at all - that's a valid outcome.

  If decoration is appropriate:
  - Start with initial placement
  - Then focus on balance, spacing, and visual harmony
  - Continue until meaningful improvements are no longer emerging

  Your goal is room-appropriate wall treatment - sometimes that means artwork and
  mirrors, sometimes just functional items, sometimes nothing at all.
