prompt: |
  Create the initial ceiling decoration for this room.

  Call observe_scene to see the elevated perspective view of the ceiling
  with furniture context below, then design and place appropriate ceiling fixtures.

  ## Room Dimensions:
  - Width: {{ room_width }}m
  - Depth: {{ room_depth }}m
  - Ceiling Height: {{ ceiling_height }}m

  ## Initial Design Workflow:

  1. Call observe_scene to see the ceiling and furniture layout below
  2. Call get_current_scene_state to confirm room dimensions
  3. Identify the primary lighting placement (usually center for main fixture)
  4. Plan ceiling fixtures considering:
     - Room size and shape
     - Furniture layout below (avoid hanging over walkways)
     - Balanced lighting coverage
     - Appropriate fixture types for room function
  5. Create TODO list based on your decoration plan
  6. Generate ceiling fixture assets (batch for style consistency)
  7. Place items using (x, y) coordinates on the ceiling plane
  8. Save object_ids from placement responses for future operations
  9. Complete TODOs systematically using designer_todo_manager
  10. Call check_physics after placing objects to detect collisions
  11. Verify decoration with observe_scene
  12. FINAL VERIFICATION: Before completing, confirm zero collisions exist. You MUST NOT
      finish while ANY collisions remain - move or remove ceiling objects that collide.

  ## Ceiling Coordinate System:
  - X: Position along room width (meters from minimum X)
  - Y: Position along room depth (meters from minimum Y)
  - Rotation: Degrees around vertical axis (Z)

  ## Return Format:

  Provide a structured summary including:
  - Ceiling-mounted objects placed with their coordinates
  - Design rationale for your choices
  - How you used the visual information to inform placement
  - Why your decoration creates balanced lighting coverage
