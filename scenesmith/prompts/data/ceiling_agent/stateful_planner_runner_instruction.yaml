  Handle ceiling decoration for this room through iterative refinement.
  Coordinate between the designer and critic agents.

  First, consider whether this room type typically has ceiling fixtures in real life.
  Some spaces may need minimal or no ceiling decoration - that's a valid outcome.

  If ceiling fixtures are appropriate:
  - Start with primary lighting (ceiling lights, pendants, chandeliers)
  - Consider auxiliary fixtures (ceiling fans, smoke detectors)
  - Focus on balanced layout and functional coverage
  - Continue until meaningful improvements are no longer emerging

  Your goal is room-appropriate ceiling treatment - primary lighting is usually
  essential, but additional fixtures depend on room type and size.
