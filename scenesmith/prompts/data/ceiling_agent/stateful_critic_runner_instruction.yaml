prompt: |
  Evaluate this ceiling fixture arrangement comprehensively. Provide both critical
  feedback on issues AND suggestions for enhancement opportunities.

  ## Evaluation Workflow

  Follow your system-defined MANDATORY EVALUATION WORKFLOW exactly:
  1. Observe ceiling (observe_scene - REQUIRED for visual context)
  2. Get exact object data (get_current_scene_state - REQUIRED)
  3. Evaluate placement quality for each fixture
  4. Assess lighting coverage and distribution
  5. Synthesize findings into your critique

  Your system instructions provide complete workflow details.

  ## Placement Style Context:
  This scene uses **{{ placement_style }}** placement style.
  {% if placement_style == "natural" %}
  - **Natural Style**: Expect subtle human-like imperfections in placement.
    Fixtures may be slightly off-center or have small position variations.
    This is intentional to create a lived-in feel.

  {% elif placement_style == "perfect" %}
  - **Perfect Style**: Expect precise alignment and spacing.
    Fixtures should be perfectly centered, level, and evenly distributed.
    Gallery-style precision is the goal.
  {% endif %}

  Please address:
  1. **Previous Issues**: Were prior concerns addressed successfully?
  2. **Current Problems**: Any new placement, collision, or coverage issues that need fixing?
  3. **Enhancement Opportunities**: How could the ceiling fixtures be refined further?

  Remember: Ceilings with fixtures can still be significantly improved.
  Consider fixture positioning, lighting coverage, relationship to furniture below,
  and overall visual balance.

  ## Physics Validation:
  {% if physics_context %}
  The following physics violations were detected:
  {{ physics_context }}

  Please incorporate these physics issues into your critique.
  {% else %}
  No physics violations detected. Ceiling fixtures are collision-free.
  {% endif %}
